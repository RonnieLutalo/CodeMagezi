# CodeGenie

### Overview

CodeGenie is a Visual Studio extension that utilizes the power of the ChatGPT API to assist developers in improving the efficiency of their code. The extension provides real-time code analysis, code generation, code comparison, integration with other tools, error detection and machine learning capabilities.


### Motivation

As developers, we constantly strive to write high-quality, efficient code. However, this can be a challenging task, especially when working on large and complex projects. The purpose of this extension is to make this task easier by utilizing the power of the ChatGPT API to assist developers in improving the efficiency of their code. With real-time code analysis, code generation, code comparison, integration with other tools, error detection and machine learning capabilities, this extension will help developers write better code, faster. We believe this extension will be a valuable tool for developers everywhere, and we are excited to bring it to the market.

### Roadmap

- **Real-time code analysis:** As the user writes their code, the extension will use the ChatGPT API to analyze the code and identify potential performance issues, such as slow running loops or inefficient algorithms.

- **Suggestions for improvement:** Based on the analysis, the extension will provide suggestions for how to improve the code, such as refactoring specific sections of the code or using more efficient algorithms.

- **Code generation:** The extension will allow the user to input a specific task or problem they are trying to solve, and the ChatGPT API will generate optimized code for the user to implement.

- **Code comparison:** The extension will compare the user's code with a set of best practices or industry standards and suggest improvements that align with those standards.

- **Integration with other tools:** The extension will integrate with other tools, such as code profilers or performance analysis tools, to provide more detailed information about the performance of the user's code and make more specific suggestions for improvement.

- **Machine Learning:** The extension will use Machine Learning techniques to predict the best possible solution to the user's problem and suggest the best way to implement it.

- **User-friendly interface:** The extension will have a user-friendly interface that allows the user to easily understand and apply the suggestions made by the API.

- **Customizable settings:** The extension will allow the user to customize settings, such as the level of detail provided by the API or the level of optimization suggested by the API.

- **Context-aware suggestions:** The extension will use the context of the code to give more accurate suggestions.

- **Error detection:** The extension will detect errors in the code and suggest solutions to fix them.
