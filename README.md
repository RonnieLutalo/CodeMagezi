# TelezaCode

### Overview

TelezaCode is a Visual Studio extension that utilizes the power of the ChatGPT API to assist developers in improving the efficiency of their code. The extension provides real-time code analysis, code generation, code comparison, integration with other tools, error detection and machine learning capabilities.


### Motivation

As developers, we constantly strive to write high-quality, efficient code. However, this can be a challenging task, especially when working on large and complex projects. The purpose of this extension is to make this task easier by utilizing the power of the ChatGPT API to assist developers in improving the efficiency of their code. With real-time code analysis, code generation, code comparison, integration with other tools, error detection and machine learning capabilities, this extension will help developers write better code, faster. We believe this extension will be a valuable tool for developers everywhere, and we are excited to bring it to the market.
