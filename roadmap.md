# CodeMagezi Roadmap

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a Visual Studio extension that utilizes the power of the ChatGPT API to assist developers in improving the efficiency of their code. The extension will provide real-time code analysis, code generation, code comparison, integration with other tools, error detection and machine learning capabilities.

As the user writes their code, the extension will use the ChatGPT API to analyze the code and identify potential performance issues, such as slow running loops or inefficient algorithms. Based on the analysis, the extension will provide suggestions for how to improve the code, such as refactoring specific sections of the code or using more efficient algorithms.

The extension will also allow the user to input a specific task or problem they are trying to solve, and the ChatGPT API will generate optimized code for the user to implement. Additionally, the extension will compare the user's code with a set of best practices or industry standards and suggest improvements that align with those standards.

The extension will also integrate with other tools, such as code profilers or performance analysis tools, to provide more detailed information about the performance of the user's code and make more specific suggestions for improvement. The extension will use machine learning techniques to predict the best possible solution to the user's problem and suggest the best way to implement it.

The extension will have a user-friendly interface that allows the user to easily understand and apply the suggestions made by the API. The extension will also allow the user to customize settings, such as the level of detail provided by the API or the level of optimization suggested by the API.

This extension aims to be a powerful tool that will help developers to improve the efficiency of their code, making the development process more efficient and less error-prone. The extension will be continuously updated and improved based on user feedback and the latest developments in the field of code optimization.
